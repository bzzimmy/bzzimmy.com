Welcome to my blog! This is where I'll be sharing my security research journey, technical write-ups, and insights from the world of bug bounty hunting.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- **Vulnerability Disclosures** - Detailed technical breakdowns of bugs I've found (after responsible disclosure, of course)
- **Security Research** - Methodologies, tools, and techniques I use in my work
- **Technical Deep-Dives** - Explorations of interesting security concepts and attack vectors
- **Learning Resources** - Tips for those getting started in security research

## Why Start a Blog?

After years of finding vulnerabilities and participating in bug bounty programs, I've accumulated a lot of knowledge that I think could be valuable to share with the community. Writing also helps me solidify my own understanding of complex topics.

## Stay Tuned

More posts coming soon. In the meantime, feel free to check out my [research](/blog#research) or connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/bzzim).

Thanks for reading!
